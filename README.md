## My Process  

### Built With  
- **Semantic HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS custom properties** for styling  
- **Flexbox** for layout  
- **Mobile-first workflow** for responsiveness  

---

### What I Learned  
This challenge helped me practice responsive design principles and improved my skills with CSS flexbox. Below is an example of code I was proud of:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  background: #fff;
  border-radius: 15px;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

### Continued Development
In the future, I want to:

- Explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid.
- Improve the accessibility of my projects.
- Experiment with adding animations and javascript for better user experience.
